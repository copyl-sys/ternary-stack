Looking Glass:T81 - Technical Roadmap


ðŸ§± Phase 1: Foundation & Fork

Goals:

Fork and modernize Project Looking Glass

Replace outdated Java3D with modern engine

Establish window rendering in 3D space

Tasks:

Fork Project Looking Glass GitHub repo

Replace Java3D with jMonkeyEngine or LWJGL

Set up build environment: Java 17+, Gradle, IntelliJ

Port rendering logic and create test scenes

Implement basic 3D window rendering, movement, and interaction



ðŸ§  Phase 2: Axion AI Integration

Goals:

Integrate Axion AI into the WM

Enable contextual behavior and runtime window intelligence

Tasks:

Create Axion IPC or plugin interface

Annotate windows with process/task metadata

Embed 3D AI agent (avatar, orb, symbol)

Allow Axion to monitor and suggest workspace changes

Build searchable, structured log format (T81 JSON)



ðŸ§® Phase 3: Ternary State System

Goals:

Support ternary logic throughout UI (-1, 0, 1)

Visual metaphors for ternary window state

Tasks:

Create ternary state engine for windows

Add rotateLeft, rotateCenter, rotateRight interactions

Build 3D ternary register viewer

Enable auto-grouping by ternary logic state



ðŸ“Š Phase 4: T81Lang Dev Tools

Goals:

Provide IDE features for .t81 and .cweb files

Enable live runtime and ternary state visualization

Tasks:

Implement T81Lang-aware code editor window

Build real-time debugger with call stacks and register view

Design memory explorer for ternary memory inspection

Support .cweb and .t81 plugins for compiler integration



ðŸ“¦ Phase 5: Packaging & Deployment

Goals:

Build cross-platform launcher and modular build

Integrate fully with T81OS and Axion runtime

Tasks:

Modular Gradle build with core, ai, vm, ui modules

Standalone launcher with DE/VM mode selector

Theme and skin system (ternary-based coloring)

Auto-detect and hook into T81OS + Axion learning mode



ðŸ”® Phase 6: Showcase & Demos

Goals:

Demonstrate core functionality to users and devs

Visualize ternary logic, Axion, and runtime interaction



Tasks:

Live T81Lang compile/run demo in 3D

Ternary registers and memory viewer

Axion workspace reorganization demo

Custom themes: LCARS, retrofuturist, sci-fi transitions



âœ¨ Stretch Goals

VR/AR support via OpenXR

Multi-monitor 3D workspace with seamless transitions

TNN (Ternary Neural Network) visualization + debugging
