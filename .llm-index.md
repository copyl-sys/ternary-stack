## T81Lang
**T81Lang** is a high-level programming language built for base-81 (ternary) logic. It features:
- Native support for ternary data types (T81BigInt, T81Float, T81Fraction)
- Symbolic and AI-optimized compilation
- Immutable-by-default types and memory-safe constructs
- A Just-In-Time (JIT) backend for TISC
- Designed for recursive and parallel execution patterns

**Keywords:** `ternary`, `compiler`, `T81`, `TISC`, `AI-native`, `JIT`, `symbolic logic`

---

## TISC Assembler
**TISC (Ternary Instruction Set Computing)** is a minimalist assembly language for ternary machines. The TISC Assembler:
- Translates T81Lang into executable instructions
- Supports symbolic, macro, and entropy-based operations
- Provides low-level control over ternary recursion and logic states

**Keywords:** `assembler`, `ternary logic`, `instruction set`, `low-level`, `symbolic execution`

---

## HanoiVM
**HanoiVM** is a recursive ternary virtual machine. It supports:
- Execution of `.hvm` bytecode using ternary stacks and macro logic
- Deep introspection of ternary states, operand entropy, and recursion depth
- Axion AI hooks for optimization and runtime introspection

**Keywords:** `virtual machine`, `ternary VM`, `recursive logic`, `stack`, `symbolic interpreter`, `entropy analysis`

---

## Axion AI
**Axion AI** is a kernel-level AI runtime that supports:
- Real-time optimization and anomaly detection
- Symbolic entropy tracing
- AI-assisted package management and compiler decisions
- Metadata blockchain for transparency and system integrity

**Keywords:** `AI kernel`, `runtime`, `symbolic optimizer`, `entropy`, `metadata blockchain`, `AI-native`

---

## Alexis Linux
**Alexis Linux** is a fully modular, AI-native operating system that integrates:
- Ternary runtime support
- Axion AI as a core component
- A modular `.cweb`-based package format with AI-driven structure
- QEMU-ready build pipelines and cross-platform compatibility

**Keywords:** `ternary OS`, `Linux`, `AI-native`, `modular`, `.cweb`, `Axion`

---

## RiftCat
**RiftCat** is a network traffic visualization plugin for Ghidra that supports:
- Layered OSI analysis of PCAP traffic
- AI-based anomaly detection for session hijacking and cryptographic anomalies
- Live integration with Wireshark and forensic export in JSON, XML, and PDF

**Keywords:** `network forensics`, `Ghidra`, `PCAP`, `AI security`, `OSI analysis`, `Wireshark`, `session detection`

---

## Project Looking Glass
**Project Looking Glass** provides a 3D Java-based GUI for ternary runtime introspection. It visualizes:
- HanoiVM recursion stacks
- Axion AI decision traces
- Ternary symbolic state and entropy heatmaps

**Keywords:** `3D GUI`, `Java3D`, `introspection`, `ternary`, `visualization`, `runtime tracing`
