# 🌐 Copyleft Systems — Unified Ternary Computing Stack

Welcome to the master repository for the **Copyleft Ternary Stack**, an experimental, AI-native computing ecosystem that spans kernel-level AI, a ternary virtual machine, a domain-specific ternary language, GPU/3D introspection, and symbolic entropy-aware packaging. This project aims to reclaim control of the full software stack—from entropy models to AI runtime.

## 🧠 System Goals

- **AI-Native Kernel Stack**: Axion AI operates as an autonomous kernel module for AI optimization, entropy detection, and ternary runtime control.
- **HanoiVM**: Ternary recursion VM with T81/T243/T729 logic, symbolic execution, and stack promotion.
- **T81Lang**: Strongly typed, AI-assisted high-level language for ternary arithmetic and system programming.
- **t81_compile.py**: Compiler CLI for `.t81` source → `.ast.json`, `.tisc`, `.entropy.json`, `.cweb`
- **Project Looking Glass**: A 3D visual window manager and introspection UI for AI behavior, ternary logic, and entropy feedback.
- **.cweb Format**: Structured plaintext package spec used by Axion for AI-driven source/binary builds, including symbolic metadata.

## 🔄 Development Guidelines

- Modularize frequently — use `.cweb` files for split components under 50MB.
- Run `t81_compile.py` against `.t81` examples and validate `.tisc`, `.cweb`, and entropy logs.
- Keep all folders non-empty (Git limitation). Use `README.md` or `.keep` files.
- Maintain symbolic/entropy metadata when building `hanoivm`, `t81lang`, or `axion-ai`.
- Update the `docs/` directory for every spec or architecture change.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C / Python / Java / CUDA / Bash
- Custom `.cweb` packaging & compiler toolchain
- Linux Kernel 6.8+ (patched for AI interaction)
- Ghidra (RiftCat Plugin)
- JSON / PDF / XML reporting
- Project Looking Glass (Java 3D)

---

## 📌 Future Goals

- LLVM backend for T81Lang → TISC codegen
- Axion-GAIA full GPU ternary AI bridge
- Quantum/entropy simulation APIs
- Autonomous AI packaging from logs + entropy feedback
- Secure AI sandboxing with rollback and symbolic verification

> This system is experimental and radical by design. Expect recursion, entropy, and AI-native decisions.
