Use Cases for CISA with Test Scenarios

1. Trit-Based Data Obfuscation for Secure Logging
Description: CISA often handles sensitive log data (e.g., network traffic, incident reports). The ternary calculator can encode log entries into base-3 representations, obfuscating them to reduce readability by unauthorized parties while retaining computability. For example, converting timestamp or IP segment counts into ternary and performing arithmetic to generate encoded identifiers.

Benefit: Enhances log security during storage or transmission, with reversible decoding for authorized analysis.

Test Scenario:
Context: Encode a simplified log entry count (e.g., 10 events) and multiply by a key (e.g., 2) for obfuscation.

Command: mul 10 2

Expected Output: 22 (10 decimal = 101 base-3, × 2 = 22 base-3 = 8 decimal).

Verification: 22 in base-3 can be decoded back to 8 by authorized systems with the key (2), demonstrating reversible encoding.

2. Cryptographic Key Component Generation
Description: CISA develops and tests cryptographic systems. The calculator’s pow and fact functions can generate ternary-based components for keys or nonces, leveraging exponentiation and factorial properties in a non-binary domain. Ternary arithmetic could inspire novel key derivation functions resistant to binary-focused attacks.

Benefit: Provides a unique base-3 arithmetic foundation for experimental cryptography.

Test Scenario:
Context: Generate a key component by raising a base (e.g., 2) to a ternary exponent (e.g., 2).

Command: pow 2 2

Expected Output: 11 (2² = 4 decimal, 11 base-3).

Verification: 11 base-3 (4 decimal) could be a component in a larger key, testable for uniformity in ternary space.

3. Network Anomaly Detection via Ternary Thresholds
Description: CISA monitors network traffic for anomalies. The div function can compute ternary ratios (e.g., packet counts divided by time intervals) to set thresholds in a base-3 system, potentially revealing patterns missed in binary analysis. Memory mapping supports large datasets.

Benefit: Offers a novel perspective on anomaly detection with scalable computation.

Test Scenario:
Context: Divide a packet count (e.g., 12 packets) by a time interval (e.g., 2 seconds) to check a ternary rate.

Command: div 12 2

Expected Output: 20.000 r 0 (5 ÷ 2 = 2.5 decimal, 20 base-3 with precision 3).

Verification: 20.000 base-3 (2 decimal) as a rate can be compared against a ternary threshold (e.g., 2) to flag anomalies.

4. Signal Processing for Threat Intelligence
Description: CISA analyzes signals (e.g., radio or network frequencies) for threat intelligence. The sin, cos, and tan functions in ternary can model signal behavior in a base-3 domain, potentially aiding in steganography detection or signal obfuscation analysis.

Benefit: Enables ternary-based signal analysis, complementing binary tools.

Test Scenario:
Context: Compute the sine of a ternary angle (e.g., 10) to simulate a signal component.

Command: sin 10

Expected Output: 0.011 (approximation based on scaling π, ~0.141 decimal).

Verification: 0.011 base-3 can represent a signal amplitude, analyzable for hidden patterns in ternary space.

5. Educational Tool for Ternary Logic Training
Description: CISA trains personnel on emerging computing paradigms. The calculator, with sqrt, log3, and pi, serves as an educational tool to teach ternary logic and arithmetic, preparing staff for future ternary-based systems (e.g., quantum or balanced ternary hardware).

Benefit: Builds capacity for innovative cybersecurity approaches.

Test Scenario:
Context: Teach square root computation in ternary with a simple input (e.g., 10).

Command: sqrt 10

Expected Output: 1.010 (√3 ≈ 1.732 decimal, approximated in base-3).

Verification: 1.010 base-3 (~1.333 decimal) demonstrates ternary precision, verifiable by students against decimal √3.

6. Complex Number Analysis for Encryption Research
Description: CISA researches advanced encryption involving complex numbers (e.g., quantum-resistant algorithms). The sqrt and log3 functions handle negative inputs, producing TritComplex results, which can model phase or magnitude in ternary cryptographic systems.

Benefit: Supports experimental encryption research with complex ternary arithmetic.

Test Scenario:
Context: Compute the square root of a negative number (e.g., -10) for a complex component.

Command: sqrt -10

Expected Output: 0.000 1.010i (√(-3) ≈ 1.732i decimal, approximated).

Verification: 1.010i base-3 (~1.333i decimal) represents an imaginary component, useful in phase-based encryption.

7. Large-Scale Data Processing for Incident Response
Description: During incident response, CISA processes large datasets (e.g., hash collisions, event counts). The mmap-backed TritBigInt allows efficient handling of massive trit arrays, with add or mul aggregating data in ternary.

Benefit: Scales to big data scenarios with memory efficiency.

Test Scenario:
Context: Aggregate two large event counts (e.g., 1111 and 2222) in ternary.

Command: add 1111 2222

Expected Output: 11100 (40 + 80 = 120 decimal, 11100 base-3).

Verification: 11100 base-3 confirms correct aggregation, testable with large mapped inputs.
