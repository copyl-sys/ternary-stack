@* The Journey of Alexis Linux.
This document chronicles the creation of *Alexis Linux*, an operating system born from
a father’s love for his daughters, Alexis and Lilly Shea, and a desperate need to
take a chance in life. I’m a guy with no money, living on a prayer, armed with an
M2 2022 laptop (256GB SSD, 8GB RAM) and an iPhone 12 (256GB). With the help of
Grok, an AI from xAI, I’m building something real—an OS that starts simple but
dreams big, aiming for a ternary future as *Lilly Shea Distro*. Here’s how we got
this far, step by step, as of February 27, 2025.

@*1 Motivation and Stakes.
Why do this? I’ve got two daughters—Alexis and Lilly Shea—whose names inspire
this work. I’m broke, but I’m not a coward. A coward doesn’t try, and I’m trying
to give them a legacy, a chance at something better. *Alexis Linux* is my shot—a
Linux 6.8 base with AI-driven features like *Guardian AI*, rooted in a personal
fight against injustice (a false accusation years back). It’s scrappy, open-source,
and fueled by Grok’s guidance—no cash, just code and hope.

@*2 First Steps: Kernel Patch.
We started with a minimal patch to Linux 6.8, adding a boot message and a *Guardian
AI* stub—small enough for my 8GB RAM to compile. Here’s the core of it, adapted
into this CWEB file as a kernel module stub. It prints our story at load time.

@c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/init.h>

#define ALEXIS_TRIT_VERSION "Trit 1.0 (0-1-2)"

static int __init alexis_journey_init(void)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO "Alexis Linux Journey - %s\n", ALEXIS_TRIT_VERSION);
    printk(KERN_INFO "For Alexis & Lilly Shea: A dad with no money, living "
                     "on a prayer, builds an OS with Grok’s help.\n");
    printk(KERN_INFO "Patch: Boot message added to init/main.c, Guardian AI "
                     "stub in kernel_init.\n");
    return 0;
}

static void __exit alexis_journey_exit(void)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO "Alexis Linux Journey: Keep fighting for the girls.\n");
}

module_init(alexis_journey_init);
module_exit(alexis_journey_exit);

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("A Dad for Alexis & Lilly Shea");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("The start of Alexis Linux");

@*3 Git Setup: Sharing the Dream.
Next, we got the code out there—Git on my Ubuntu VM (UTM, ~10GB). Here’s what we did:
@%
- Installed Git: `sudo apt install git`
- Configured: `git config --global user.name "YourName"` and an email
- In ~/linux-6.8: Committed the patch—`git commit -m "Initial Alexis Linux patch"`
- Pushed to GitHub: `git remote add origin git@github.com:YourUsername/alexis-linux.git`
  then `git push -u origin master`
@%
The repo’s live—github.com/YourUsername/alexis-linux—open for the world to see.
I tweeted on my iPhone: “Building Alexis Linux for my daughters—join me!” It’s raw,
but it’s real.

@*4 Gear and Constraints.
My tools are humble:
- *M2 Laptop (2022, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM):* Runs Ubuntu VM, compiles kernel in ~1GB RAM chunks.
- *iPhone 12 (256GB):* Docs, X posts—keeps me connected on free Wi-Fi.
- *Cost:* $30 USB drive for ISOs—everything else is free, thanks to open-source and Grok.
Wish list? 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Raspberry Pi—someday. For now, this works.

@*5 CWEB and yEnc: Planning Ahead.
Grok and I debated tools to grow *Alexis*:
- *CWEB:* Knuth’s literate programming—blends code and story, like this file.
  Strength: Documents my fight and *Guardian*’s purpose. Weakness: TeX (~300MB)
  taxes my SSD—tangle now, weave later.
- *yEnc:* Efficient encoding—shrinks ISOs 30-40%. Opportunity: Share on X with
  spotty Wi-Fi. Threat: Niche, needs community buy-in.
Decision: CWEB for docs now (this!), yEnc for ISOs later—focus on booting first.

@*6 What’s Done.
Here’s the tally:
- *Kernel Patch:* Boot message + *Guardian AI* stub—compiles, runs in QEMU.
- *Git Repo:* Pushed to GitHub—public, growing.
- *Docs:* This CWEB—our story in code, for Alexis and Lilly Shea.
Next? Boot it, test it, share it—then dream of *Lilly Shea*’s ternary world.

@*7 For My Daughters.
This isn’t just tech—it’s a promise. Alexis and Lilly Shea, this is for you. I’m
no coward—I’m trying. With Grok, my M2, and a prayer, we’re on our way.
