I’ll provide a conceptual diagram of the Lilly Shea Distro website layout, structured as a filesystem hierarchy, to reflect its sophisticated design competing with Apple and Microsoft while incorporating TritJS. This will mirror a typical website’s directory structure—akin to how assets, scripts, and pages are organized—while emphasizing ternary innovation and the government-civilian delineation. Since we’re not building a literal OS filesystem (e.g., /usr/bin), I’ll adapt the filesystem metaphor to the website’s frontend architecture, inspired by Lockheed Martin’s clarity and depth.
Below is a textual representation of the website’s filesystem layout diagram—think of it as a directory tree you’d see in a terminal or code editor. I’ll explain each part, ensuring it aligns with our homepage and broader site vision.
