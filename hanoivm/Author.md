### üí° About Me

Michael J. Kane II is a systems architect and veteran whose expertise spans from military-grade wireless systems to bleeding-edge ternary computing architectures. As a former Linux kernel contributor and AI systems designer, Michael focuses on recursive logic, symbolic execution, and post-quantum AI integration.

He is the founder of **Axion AI**, a next-generation package manager designed for autonomous optimization and secure `.cweb`-based software delivery, and architect of **HanoiVM**, a ternary recursive virtual machine aimed at redefining how logic, recursion, and computation interact. His work explores the intersection of AI, ternary data models, and GPU-dispatch frameworks with a long-term vision for fully AI-native operating systems.
