# 🚀 HanoiVM — Recursive Ternary Virtual Machine | 

Goal A) Alexis Linux; (hybrid 'binary/ternary' linux via kernel module axion-io.ko);

Goal B) Lilly Shea (ternary-linux; no module needed) 

      // Note; I do not call it linux after this point.
      Thank you for an education Linus; that is all. 

**HanoiVM** is a recursive, AI-augmented **ternary virtual machine** built on a symbolic base-81 architecture. It serves as the execution core of the **Axion + T81Lang** ecosystem, enabling stack-tier promotion, symbolic AI opcodes, and entropy-aware transformations across three logic levels:

- 🔹 **T81**: 81-bit operand logic (register-like)
- 🔸 **T243**: Symbolic BigInt + FSM state logic
- 🔺 **T729**: Tensor-based AI macros with semantic dispatch, including our new **Symbolic AI Graph IR (T729LogicGraph)**

Designed for research, language development, and future ternary hardware acceleration, **HanoiVM** is a literate, modular, and fully recursive platform with integrated debugging, telemetry, and cross-language support.

## 🔍 Core Features

- **Ternary Operand Architecture**  
  Supports `uint81_t`, `T243BigInt`, and `T729Tensor` data types.

- **Recursive Stack Tiering**  
  Auto-promotes through `T81 → T243 → T729` based on recursion depth and entropy metrics.

- **Symbolic AI Execution**  
  - Implements FSM logic, pattern recognition, and entropy-driven dispatch.
  - Features AI macros such as `TNN_ACCUM`, `T81_MATMUL`, `T729_INTENT`, and `T729_META_EXEC`.
  - Now enhanced with our **Symbolic AI Graph IR (T729LogicGraph)** for advanced optimization and introspection.

- **Tensor Engine & Holomorphic Support**  
  Provides operations like `DOT`, `SLICE`, `TRANSPOSE`, `RESHAPE`, `CLONE`, `PRINT`, and FFT for multidimensional signal processing.

- **Axion Kernel AI**  
  - Offers AI introspection, rollback, and optimization via NLP-style commands (`optimize`, `snapshot`).
  - Integrated telemetry, logging, and entropy weighting.

- **GPU Acceleration via GAIA**  
  - NVIDIA: `cuda_handle_request.cu`
  - AMD: `gaia_handle_request.cweb`

- **Cross-Language FFI Support**  
  - The FFI layer in `hanoivm_ffi.cweb` provides a C ABI interface.
  - Shared library (`libhanoivm_ffi.so`) allows integration with Rust, Python, and C++.

- **3D Visualization via Looking Glass**  
  - Uses `FrameSceneBuilder.cweb` for rendering recursion traces (e.g., with jMonkeyEngine).
  - Includes Axion overlays, ternary geometry, and entropy pulse animations.

- **Literate Codebase**  
  - All modules are written as `.cweb` sources, making the codebase self-documenting and extractable with `cweave`/`ctangle`.

- **Disassembler & Test Infrastructure**  
  - Disassembles `.hvm` bytecode with symbolic introspection.
  - CI-compatible tests and kernel-mode driver support for system-level validation.

## 📦 T81Lang Compiler Stack

The T81Lang toolchain is fully integrated with HanoiVM:

- **Lexer & Parser**: Implemented in `t81lang_parser.cweb`
- **Semantic Analyzer**: Handles scope and symbol resolution
- **Intermediate Representation (IR)**: Generates symbolic ops
- **.hvm Emitter**: Converts IR into executable bytecode

## 🔗 FFI & Cross-Language Integration

HanoiVM supports multi-language embedding through a robust FFI layer.

### 🔧 Compile the Shared Library:

```bash
make libhanoivm_ffi.so
```

### 📚 Available APIs:
