## Example Code Snippets

### T243 ‚Äî State Machine Transition

```t81lang
function transition_state(signal: T81BigInt): T81BigInt {
    let current_state = T243StateVector(0);  // Initial state
    let transition_map = T243MarkovMatrix();  // Define state transition matrix
    
    t243_state_advance(&current_state, signal);  // Advance the state
    return current_state;

    let result = T729Tensor.zeros(A.rows, B.cols);
    for i in 0 to A.rows - 1 {
        for j in 0 to B.cols - 1 {
            result[i][j] = sum(A[i, k] * B[k, j] for k in 0 to A.cols - 1);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
