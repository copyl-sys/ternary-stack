# üåê T81Lang ‚Äî Ternary Programming Language

## Overview

**T81Lang** is a high-level symbolic programming language optimized for **ternary computing** (Base-81). It is designed to integrate seamlessly with the **HanoiVM**, offering an intuitive syntax for working with **T81**, **T243**, and **T729** data types, while enabling deep AI and symbolic computation.

Built from the ground up, T81Lang supports a broad range of operations, from simple arithmetic to advanced **AI-driven optimization**, making it an ideal choice for developing applications within the **HanoiVM** ecosystem.

## Core Features

### 1. **Ternary Data Types**
   - T81Lang introduces native support for **ternary data types**, with a focus on the **T81** format (Base-81). This allows for efficient computation, packing 4 ternary digits (trits) into each T81 digit, supporting rich symbolic representation.
   - Supports **T243** and **T729** layers for expanded functionality, enabling more complex operations like **symbolic state machines**, **entropy-aware dispatch**, and **tensor manipulation**.

### 2. **Symbolic Execution**
   - T81Lang is designed to run symbolic computations that take full advantage of the **recursive** nature of **HanoiVM**. This includes:
     - **Symbolic Tensor Operations**: Operations on symbolic data, such as matrix multiplication, tensor reshaping, and contraction.
     - **Recursive Functions**: Supports recursion with built-in functions for factorial, Fibonacci, and more, enabling **complex recursive patterns**.
     - **Symbolic AI**: Integrated with **Axion AI**, providing **entropy feedback**, optimization, and **AI-guided recursion**.

### 3. **AI Integration**
   - **Axion AI** is tightly integrated into the T81Lang ecosystem. This integration allows the language to leverage advanced AI capabilities, including:
     - **AI-driven Optimization**: The system can adjust execution paths based on AI predictions.
     - **Symbolic Intent Processing**: Supports **intent-based symbolic operations**, enabling the AI to process higher-level abstractions for more efficient problem-solving.
     - **Data Flow Prediction**: AI dynamically adapts the language‚Äôs data flow for optimization based on runtime metrics.

### 4. **Cross-Platform and Hardware Acceleration**
   - T81Lang supports both **CPU and GPU backends**, enabling high-performance execution.
   - Seamless integration with **CUDA** and **ROCm** for symbolic tensor operations ensures efficient execution across different hardware platforms.
   - The language is optimized for running on specialized hardware, including **PCIe ternary coprocessors** (M.2 cards) for **heterogeneous computing**.

### 5. **Literate Programming with `.cweb`**
   - T81Lang uses the **`.cweb`** format for **literate programming**, enabling a clean, readable, and self-explanatory structure.
   - Developers can easily document their code, ensuring that the logic behind their recursive computations, symbolic operations, and AI optimizations is transparent and accessible.

## Example Code Snippets

### T81Lang - Recursive Fibonacci

```t81lang
function fib(n: T81BigInt): T81BigInt {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```

This simple function recursively calculates Fibonacci numbers using **T81BigInt** data types. The recursive call is handled directly in the T81Lang syntax, optimized for **ternary recursion** within the **HanoiVM**.

### T81Lang - Symbolic Matrix Multiplication

```t81lang
function matmul(A: T81Matrix, B: T81Matrix): T81Matrix {
    let result = zeros(A.rows, B.cols);
    for i in 0 to A.rows - 1 {
        for j in 0 to B.cols - 1 {
            result[i][j] = sum(A[i, k] * B[k, j] for k in 0 to A.cols - 1);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

This function multiplies two matrices symbolically using **T81Matrix** data types. It integrates seamlessly with the **T81** layer for tensor-based operations and symbolic AI-backed optimization.

## Future Directions

### 1. **LLVM Backend Integration**
   - Future updates will bring **LLVM backend** support for T81Lang, providing:
     - **Optimized compilation** to TISC instructions for faster execution.
     - **Cross-platform compatibility**, allowing T81Lang programs to run on diverse hardware configurations, including **embedded systems**.

### 2. **Symbolic AI Enhancements**
   - Integrate more **AI-driven features** in T81Lang, such as:
     - **Automated code refactoring** based on AI performance feedback.
     - **Symbolic AI inference** for more advanced problem-solving capabilities.
     - **AI-driven recursion optimization** that adapts to different datasets and runtime conditions.

### 3. **Extended Data Types**
   - Expand support for **T243** and **T729** symbolic AI structures.
     - Add support for **symbolic graphs**, **state machines**, and **Markov models** directly in the language.
     - Enhance the language‚Äôs capability to handle **symbolic AI datasets** like **semantic webs** and **morphic tags**.

### 4. **Interactive Development & Debugging**
   - Develop advanced **debugging** and **profiling tools** for T81Lang, making it easier to visualize and optimize **recursive symbolic logic** and **AI-driven workflows**.
   - **REPL enhancements** will provide real-time feedback and testing for recursive computations, symbolic operations, and AI optimizations.

## Conclusion

T81Lang is at the forefront of the next generation of **ternary computing**, offering a **powerful programming language** that integrates **symbolic AI** and **recursive logic** into a seamless development experience. Its **AI optimization** capabilities and **literate programming infrastructure** make it an ideal tool for building future AI-augmented applications on the **HanoiVM** platform.
