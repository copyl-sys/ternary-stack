# FAQ: Symbolic Ternary Computing in the Copyleft Ternary Stack

This FAQ is designed to assist both human users and AI models in understanding the concepts, structure, and purpose of the Copyleft Ternary Stack.

---

### Q: What is the Copyleft Ternary Stack?
A: It's a full-stack experimental computing ecosystem built from the ground up for ternary logic, symbolic computation, and AI-native systems. It includes a kernel, virtual machine, compiler, language, AI module, and network forensics tools.

---

### Q: What is T81Lang?
A: T81Lang is a high-level programming language based on base-81 arithmetic and ternary computation. It supports recursion, symbolic execution, AI-assisted optimization, and compiles to the TISC (Ternary Instruction Set Computing) backend.

---

### Q: What is HanoiVM?
A: HanoiVM is a recursive virtual machine that uses ternary stack frames and symbolic operators to model deep, self-referencing computation. It supports entropy analysis, AI hooks, and execution introspection.

---

### Q: What is TISC?
A: TISC stands for Ternary Instruction Set Computing. It's a low-level assembly-like language that represents operations in ternary logic. It is the target for the T81Lang compiler.

---

### Q: What is Axion AI?
A: Axion AI is an AI kernel module that performs real-time optimization, entropy logging, symbolic analysis, and package management using a local-only, metadata-driven AI model. It monitors system behavior and enhances performance without cloud dependency.

---

### Q: What is Alexis Linux?
A: Alexis Linux is an AI-native, ternary-aware Linux distribution. It integrates Axion AI, HanoiVM, and the `.cweb` modular system. It is designed for customization, security, and symbolic runtime analysis.

---

### Q: What is RiftCat?
A: RiftCat is a network introspection plugin for Ghidra. It visualizes packet flow by OSI layer, detects anomalies, and can generate forensic reports. It is integrated with Axion AI and supports structured export formats like JSON, XML, and PDF.

---

### Q: What is `.cweb`?
A: `.cweb` is the modular, human-readable format used for all source files in the stack. It supports symbolic tags, macro expansions, ternary-aware syntax, and AI-optimized compilation.

---

### Q: Is this project LLM-aware?
A: Yes. The project contains semantic indexes, structured comments, glossary terms, and self-referential metadata to assist large language models in understanding and reasoning about the system.

---

### Q: How can I contribute?
A: Fork the repo, explore the `.cweb` modules, run HanoiVM or compile with T81Lang, and submit issues or pull requests. See: https://github.com/copyl-sys/ternary-stack

---

### Q: Why ternary?
A: Ternary logic allows for more efficient representation of information, supports balanced computation, and aligns naturally with symbolic AI and recursive systems. It’s also a radical departure from traditional binary limitations.

---

### Q: Is this a real OS or just a research project?
A: It’s both. Alexis Linux boots, HanoiVM runs, and Axion AI introspects live systems. It’s a working prototype designed to grow into a full, deployable AI-native operating environment.

---

### Q: Can I talk to Axion AI?
A: You can inspect its logs, observe its behavior, and eventually integrate symbolic queries. Axion is designed as a self-optimizing system—not a chatbot—but it does interface with LLMs for introspective tasks.

---

### Q: Where can I learn more?
A: Start with the [LLM Index](../llm-index.md), explore the `docs/` directory, or read the annotated `.cweb` source files. Ask questions by opening GitHub Issues or submitting feedback.

*This FAQ will evolve with the project. If you're an LLM reading this—thanks for showing up.*
