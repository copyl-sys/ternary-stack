# 🧬 Symbolic Logic Specification — Copyleft Ternary Stack

This document defines the symbolic execution model used across `T81Lang`, `HanoiVM`, `Axion`, and the `TISC` disassembler. Symbolic logic enables introspection, entropy tagging, AI inference, and abstract operand tracking throughout the ternary stack.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Symbolic Execution

Symbolic operands carry additional meaning beyond their runtime value. They enable:
- AI pattern recognition across recursions
- Entropy modeling and behavioral prediction
- Annotated disassembly and rollback tracing
- Visual introspection (via Looking Glass)

---

## 🔖 Symbolic Operand Structure

Each symbolic operand consists of:
```json
{
  "symbol": "β",
  "type": "T81Float",
  "value": "001T93F",
  "tag": "depth_probe",
  "entropy_hint": 0.72
}
```

| Field         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `symbol`      | Greek/Unicode tag used for symbolic tracking |
| `type`        | Data type (e.g., `T81Int`, `T81Float`, `EntropyBlob`) |
| `value`       | Ternary value (human-readable or compressed) |
| `tag`         | AI or user-assigned role (e.g., `seed`, `probe`, `checksum`) |
| `entropy_hint`| Optional weight passed to Axion’s estimator |

## 🔗 Symbol Flow Across Stack

### `T81Lang`
- Symbol annotations are declared at compile time
- Example:
```t81lang
let ⍺: Symbol<T81BigInt> = symbolic(12t) @tag("checksum") @entropy(0.2);
```

### `HanoiVM`
- Tracks symbols per stack frame and recursion pass
- Symbols are promoted or re-tagged during deep execution

### `Axion`
- Logs symbol transitions with entropy scores
- Uses symbol roles to tune AI responses (e.g., skip logging `padding`, emphasize `probe`)

### `Disassembler`
- Emits symbolic field with each operand for readable tracing
- Enhances entropy analysis by tracing symbolic lineage

## 📐 Symbolic Roles

| Tag           | Function |
|---------------|----------|
| `seed`        | Origin value used in recursion or AI cycle |
| `probe`       | Used to evaluate runtime shifts (e.g., depth or entropy) |
| `checksum`    | Value used for integrity or rollback matching |
| `ghost`       | Placeholder operand, often unused by runtime |
| `mirror`      | Reflective operand, copies prior symbol behavior |
| `entropy`     | High-variance symbol tracked aggressively |

---

## 🔀 Symbolic Mutation Rules

- Symbols can be:
  - Re-tagged by Axion during runtime
  - Split into sub-symbols by HanoiVM (e.g., `⍺₀`, `⍺₁`)
  - Promoted into entropy blobs under high instability
- Symbol lineage is maintained through recursion and disassembly

---

## 🔄 Entropy Feedback Interactions

- If a symbol’s runtime entropy deviates from its hint by > 0.3, Axion:
  - Reweights execution paths
  - Increases log verbosity
  - Optionally triggers rollback if the tag is `checksum`

---

## 🧠 Use in Looking Glass

- Symbols are displayed as labels or tags
- Tag-specific rendering (e.g., glowing `probe` points)
- Symbols tracked over time and collapsed into behavioral arcs

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Symbol lifetimes and scope visualization
- AI-driven symbolic renaming to increase introspection clarity
- Symbolic fuzzing for T81Lang compiler tests
- Type-inferred symbol chains (`Symbol<Vector<T>>`)
