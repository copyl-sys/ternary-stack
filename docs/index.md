# Welcome to the Copyleft Ternary Stack

**An AI-native, post-binary computing ecosystem**

---

## 🔷 What is This Project?
The Copyleft Ternary Stack is a full-stack computing platform designed around:
- Ternary logic (base-3, base-81)
- AI-native integration at all levels
- Symbolic and entropy-aware execution
- Full introspection from virtual machine to GUI

It includes:
- **Alexis Linux** — a modular, ternary-aware OS
- **Axion AI** — AI kernel module for runtime reasoning
- **HanoiVM** — recursive ternary virtual machine
- **T81Lang** — high-level ternary programming language
- **TISC** — ternary assembly language and compiler backend
- **RiftCat** — TCP/IP oscilloscope & forensic tool
- **Project Looking Glass** — 3D visualization for AI + system introspection

All components are designed to be open, symbolic, and extensible.
