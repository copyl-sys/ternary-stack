# 🔥 Entropy Model Specification — Axion & HanoiVM

This document defines the entropy-based introspection and feedback model used in the Copyleft Ternary Stack. It connects symbolic execution, runtime mutation, and AI optimization through an entropy-driven feedback loop. This is core to Axion's self-healing and anomaly detection system.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Entropy** in this context is a symbolic metric of runtime uncertainty, complexity, or deviation.
- It is **measured per instruction**, **per operand**, and **per session**.
- Entropy models are used to trigger:
  - AI-guided recompilation
  - System rollback
  - Package re-splitting
  - Visual alerts (via Looking Glass)

## 🔁 Entropy Lifecycle

```
  [ HanoiVM Execution ]

  [ Operand Decoding + Symbolic Tags ]
          ↓
  [ Axion Entropy Estimation Engine ]
          ↓
  [ Score Assignment + Entropy Log ]
          ↓
  [ AI Response: Optimize | Recompile | Alert ]

## 📈 Scoring System

### Scale: `0.0` (stable) to `1.0` (max entropy)

| Range        | Meaning                      |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| `0.0–0.2`    | Stable execution              |
| `0.3–0.5`    | Normal ternary mutation       |
| `0.6–0.8`    | Anomalous behavior (loggable) |
| `0.9–1.0`    | Instability detected          |

> Axion may trigger rollback or alert for values `> 0.75`

---

## 🧬 Factors in Entropy Evaluation

- Operand mutation over time
- Recursion depth and frequency
- Type instability (e.g., T81Float vs. Symbol<T>)
- Stack oscillation or sudden shifts
- Instruction pattern entropy (symbolic repetition, cycle)
- AI-defined thresholds (adaptive per session)

---

## 📁 Log Format

Stored in `/logs/entropy/SESSION_ID.json`

Example:
```json
{
  "session": "abc123",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-27T18:44:00Z",
  "instruction": "TISC_81ADD",
  "operand": {
    "type": "T81BigInt",
    "symbol": "⍺",
    "value": "00018T"
  },
  "entropy": 0.83,
  "action": "rollback_triggered"
}
```

---

## 🛰️ Integration Points

- **HanoiVM** injects entropy tracepoints into opcode execution
- **Disassembler** emits JSON with symbolic metadata and entropy tags
- **Axion** writes logs and triggers AI refinement decisions
- **Looking Glass** visualizes anomalies in a time-flow view

## ⚠️ Reactions to Entropy

| Action            | Trigger Condition |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `Log`             | `entropy > 0.6`   |
| `Recompile`       | `entropy > 0.7`   |
| `Rollback`        | `entropy > 0.75`  |
| `Sandbox`         | `entropy > 0.9`   |

---

## 📡 AI Feedback Loop

1. Session logs are analyzed post-execution
2. Patterns are used to suggest ternary-safe rewrites
3. Package `.cweb` files are optionally regenerated with updated flags
4. Entropy zones are tagged for symbolic awareness in future runs

---

## 🔒 Security Implications

- Entropy logs are cryptographically signed
- All actions (rollback, recompile) are verifiable in local metadata chain
- Logs are filterable by instruction, opcode, score, and time window

---

## 📈 Visualization (via Looking Glass)

- Redshift effect: higher entropy zones glow
- Timeline arc: recursion depth vs entropy
- Click-to-inspect: entropy blob structure + symbolic causes
